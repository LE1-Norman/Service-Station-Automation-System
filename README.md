This project aims to develop a desktop application for car service stations that will automate management and monitoring processes.

The application implements a car service station management system, which includes the following components: a page for workers' specialties, a page for serviced cars, a page on serviced customers, a data page on workers, a malfunction data page, and a service rendered data page. 
All data is stored in a separate database and various entity relations are implemented. 
Each application page has the ability to add, delete, modify and filter data as well as create a PDF report of the station operation and download data from XML files. 
Since each customer may have more than one car, the app provides the ability to see all cars belonging to an individual customer.

The app has a user-friendly interface and will be easy for operators. The application can be used for real-world projects involving service stations.
Technologies such as Java, Hibernate, Swing, MySQL and Maven were used in development.
